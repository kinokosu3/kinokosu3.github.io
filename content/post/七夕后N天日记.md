This is a late diary.

My English has never improved.

oh, I do not want.  Maybe I’m very lazy recently.

A couple of was Chinese Valentine’s Day. But I am in Zhuhai a few ago day.

My girlfriend gave me a gift.  Of course, after appointment time.

That’s so surprised. Maybe. Because she sent picture of gift before. 

I am touching. This is my first gift in my life. No one has ever given a gift.  The sound so painful. The strong was single. 

I love her, although so disgusting, she is my only female friend.

Actually, Hong Kong, super expensive food. I feel Hong Kong people all have iPhone.
